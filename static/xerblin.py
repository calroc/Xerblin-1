Tuple-based persistent stack.

This is too simple to document.  It's almost too simple to implement.

'''
BTree
=================================

This is a simple Binary Tree implementation that uses tuples in such a
way as to permit "persistant" usage, i.e. all previous versions of the
btree datastructures are retained and available (provided you don't throw
them away yourself.)

The empty tree is represented as an empty tuple.  Nodes are a tuple
consisting of a key, a value, and two (possible empty) sub-nodes for the
lower and higher branches of the tree.

This module defines the following functions:

    insert(node, key, value)

    get(node, key)

    delete(node, key)

Both insert() and delete() return a new tuple that is the result of
applying the operation to the existing node.  (And both get() and delete()
will raise KeyErrors if the key is not in the tree.)

Because of the way that insert() and delete() are written, only as much
of the tree is changed as necessary and the rest of it is reused. This
provides persistance without using up memory for each version of the
tree.

These functions are implemented recursively so they have the potential to
raise a RuntimeError if the maximum recursion depth is exceeded.  This
should only be a problem if used with very large trees.  To avoid this
issue you can use sys.setrecursionlimit(), but I think I might just
rewrite these to not use recursion.

'''
Xerblin Base
=================================

This module builds a Xerblin system out of purely "Functional" parts.

An interpreter is represented by a two-tuple that holds a stack and a
dictionary.

The stack is a sort of linked list structure while the dictionary is a
BTree that maps string names to four kinds of entries:

Functions - These must accept an interpreter, modify it somehow, and
return the modified interpreter.  They are defined in the library
module.

Or, one of three kinds of tuple.  The kind of the tuple is indicated
by its first member, which is a handler function, and the rest of the
tuple consists in its body as indicated:

    (handle_sequence, func0, func1, func2, ...)

    (handle_branch, true_func, false_func)

    (handle_loop, func0, func1, func2, ...)

where any of the functions can be themselves SEQ, BRANCH, LOOP, or
plain functions as described above.

Interpretation is done by means of an apply_func(interpreter, function)
function that knows how to deal with the above combo-word tuples as well
as library word functions.

The first three functions defined in this module are used to build
"combo" commands in the UI.  There are corresponding commands in the
library (NewSeqWord, NewLoopWord, and NewBranchWord) that build tuples
with these functions as the first item in the tuple.  When apply_func()
encounters these tuples the initial handler function is used to "run" the
other functions in the tuple.

The three functions are:

    handle_sequence

    handle_branch

    handle_loop

The apply_func() function is used by the handlers and the interpret()
function to "run" commands on the interpreter.
